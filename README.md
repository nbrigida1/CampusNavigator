# CampusNavigator
My Role in this project was to implement the Backend
- I created back-end interface to connect the Dijkstra Algorithm and the custom data format to the front-end interface
– The Campus Navigation App allows users to map out the most efficient route between buildings at UW-Madison
– This application utilizes a Graph data structure and Dijkstra’s Algorithm
– Finds the shortest walking path and distance between two buildings (lecture halls, dorms, dining halls, etc.) at UW-Madison
